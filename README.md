🧱 Structure and Syntax

🔹 HTML

The website follows semantic HTML5 standards to ensure proper document structure and accessibility. Key structural elements include:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type for HTML5.

<header>, <main>, <footer>: Define key content regions of the page.

<nav>: Houses the main navigation links.

<section> and <article>: Organize related content areas like projects, skills, and experience.

<h1> through <h6>: Used for hierarchical headings, maintaining semantic order.

<a>, <img>, <ul>, <li>: Enable links, imagery, and structured lists.


Each element is used purposefully to convey meaning and enhance SEO and accessibility (via attributes like alt, title, and ARIA roles when needed).

🔹 CSS

Styling is accomplished using CSS3 with a focus on:

Separation of concerns: All styles are placed in external .css files.

Selectors: ID, class, pseudo-classes (e.g. :hover, :focus) and element selectors are used for targeted styling.

Box Model: Understanding and managing margin, padding, border, and content areas is foundational to the layout.

Flexbox and Grid: Used to build responsive layouts and align elements efficiently.

Media Queries: Support responsiveness across devices and screen sizes.

Custom Properties (CSS variables): Employed for reusability and theming consistency.


The stylesheet is organized logically, grouping styles for layout, typography, navigation, and individual sections.
